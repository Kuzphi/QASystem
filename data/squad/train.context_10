Phonological phenomena are no longer seen as operating on one linear sequence of segments , called phonemes or feature combinations , but rather as involving some parallel sequences of features which reside on multiple tiers . Autosegmental phonology later evolved into feature geometry , which became the standard theory of representation for theories of the organization of phonology as different as lexical phonology and optimality theory .

Early MPEG Layer III encoders used what is now called Constant Bit Rate ( CBR ) . The software was only able to use a uniform bitrate on all frames in an MP3 file . Later more sophisticated MP3 encoders were able to use the bit reservoir to target an average bit rate selecting the encoding rate for each frame based on the complexity of the sound in that portion of the recording .
Still , advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the Global South . Large-scale industry and more centralized media made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century , leading to wars that were also unprecedented .

MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags , or just treat them as ignorable , non-MP3 junk data .

Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Paleolithic era .
Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see . Night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light . Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices , increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source .

A typical protein-coding gene is first copied into RNA as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product . :6.1 In other cases , the RNA molecules are the actual functional products , as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA . Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function , and microRNA has a regulatory role . The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are transcribed are known as non-coding RNA genes .

Finite symmetry groups such as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory , which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data , and in CD players .

Heartwood ( or duramen ) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay . Heartwood formation occurs spontaneously ( it is a genetically programmed process ) . Once heartwood formation is complete , the heartwood is dead . Some uncertainty still exists as to whether heartwood is truly dead , as it can still chemically react to decay organisms , but only once .
In addition to the minimal units that can serve the purpose of differentiating meaning ( the phonemes ) , phonology studies how sounds alternate , i.e . replace one another in different forms of the same morpheme ( allomorphs ) , as well as , for example , syllable structure , stress , feature geometry , accent , and intonation .

Many bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway . The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south . Of course , in the southern hemisphere the directions are reversed , but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration .
According to the endurance running hypothesis , long-distance running as in persistence hunting , a method still practiced by some hunter-gatherer groups in modern times , was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics . This hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis : both subsistence strategies could have been in use – sequentially , alternating or even simultaneously .
